# WhatPulse-Alternative

This will probably be badly formatted cuz I have no idea how this works. Hopefully will improve it later.

My goal with this is to make a program with the same or nearly the same functionality as a program called WhatPulse.
The features that WhatPulse Alternative currently have are:
* Monitoring the number of keyboard presses
* Monitoring the number of left clicks
* Monitoring the number of right clicks
* Monitoring the number of middle mouse button clicks
* Monitoring the number of scrools (Each click when using the scroll wheel)
* A GUI to display all of the data mentioned above

**Installation Instructions:**
- Download all the files by clicking on the green button labeled "Code" and then clicking on "Download ZIP".
- Unzip the download zip file in the folder where you want the program to be.
- Delete "README.md" because it is useless now.
- Now you are basically done. You can run the "main.py" file for the program to run. **Only follow the next steps if you want the program to run on startup**, in other words, if you want the program to run everytime your computers is turned on.
- Right click on the "main.py" file and click on "Create shortcut".
- Right click on the shortcut you just created and click on "Properties". After that, copy the file path in the "Target:" field and delete the shortcut since you won't need it anymore.
- Be very careful in this step since it has to do something with the registry. Open the registry editor and navigate to "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run".
- Click on "Edit"->"New"->"String Value" from the toolbar. Name that whatever you want but preferably "WhatPulse Alternative".
- Double click the string value that you just made and paste what you copied from the shortcut in the "Value data:" field.

**Usage Guide:** Gonna do this later.

**FAQ:**
- idk, no question was frequent.
